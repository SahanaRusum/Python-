""" for loop- is a type of loop used in python. It's an entry based loop.
The basic syntax is: for variable in sequence:
    # Block of code to be executed
range() is often used with a for loop to create a sequence of numbers.
Syntax: range(start, stop, step), where:
start: The starting value (default is 0).
stop: The ending value (exclusive).
step: The difference between each number (default is 1).
